This repository is designed to be a one-stop destination for a minimal working repo integrating ```OpenGL```, ```SDL3``` and ```bullet3```.
Simply download/clone the repo and run different ```.cpp``` files in the ```src``` folder. 


To get a minimal working setup for only ```bullet3```, one can follow this [repo](https://github.com/erwincoumans/hello_bullet_cmake).
